# Social Media Challenge

This part of the Datathon repository contains the code relevant to the Social
Media challenge. It has the following contents:

1. Harvesting code in `harvest`
2. Topic modelling code in `topics`
3. Sentiment classification and emotion extraction code in `sentiments`
4. Social network analysis code in `sna`

## Harvesting

The provided harvesting code can be used to harvest the following social media
sites:

* YouTube
* Twitter



### Authentication

Note that access to all APIs used in the harvesting code requires authentication
tokens. You can generate your own tokens to use for harvesting, should you wish
to harvest on your own. In order to generate a token you need to have the
following:

* a developer account with the respective social media site
* an API key and an API secret
* run the provided authentication code locally (not on the data lab!) to
  complete the OAuth dance, store the resulting token and provide it to the
  harvesting code.

For details on how to do authentication for the APIs used, see the scripts
provided.


## Analytical code

All code has been documented in the respective directories/files.
